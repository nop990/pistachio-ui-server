# Pistachio UI

The goal of this fork is to experiment with Flask and Angular 19 to develop a PWA (Progressive Web Application) for Pistachio that increases convenience, efficiency, and ease of use for the end-user.

# Squirrel's description for Pistachio

Pistachio is a projection system for the computer game Out of the Park Baseball.

It projects:

OPS+ and WAR by position for position players

FIP and WAR for starter and reliever pitchers

With thanks to three public sources of info used for the original projections:

> Sgt Mushroom for his MOPS system for position players (https://www.youtube.com/@sgtmushroom)

> Donkeykong - a user on the OOTP forums - for pitchers

> OOTP calculator for logic for getting from FIP to WAR for pitchers (https://ootpcalculator.com/)

I first built this for a previous version of OOTP. There are various analytical points that are not up-to-date as compared to the latest version (OOTP 26 at the time of writing). That said, I think this is in usable shape for OOTP 26.

Any clear errors arising are my own, not due to the creators mentioned above.

Pull requests and feedback welcomed.

Player names saved in 'flagged.txt' can be found in the outputs by typing 'flag' in the search box at the top of the html. This can be used for eg draft prospects, or any other shortlist of players created in-game.
